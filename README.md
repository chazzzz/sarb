#ARC (Awesome RESTful Core)

This project is intended to create a kickass web application core project offering common web application features like records management (entity CRUD operations), user management, mobile REST API support, and many more.

This will serve as the compilation of the skills I've earned for the past two years that I've been working on web applications as a Java Developer.

This project uses *Spring Core, MVC, and Data*, *Hibernate*, and *Logback* for logging.

#Features

#### Spring Profiles
Many projects that I have encountered are not really giving great importance to the different configuration of the project per each different environments (i.e. development, testing, and production). As a result, the structure of the configuration files and many environment specific resources are not properly organized.

ARC handles environment changes perfectly by using Spring Profiles.
