#SARB (Super Awesome RESTful Backbone)

This project is intended to create a kickass web application template with modular features targetting common web application stuffs like records management (entity CRUD operations), user management, mobile REST API support, and many more.

This will be a compilation of my skills I've earned for the past two years that I've been working on web applications as Java Developer.
